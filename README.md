# Introduction
1. Brain inspired computer code or smart apps, called **AGI or artificial _general_ intelligence** (predicted to happen by [as soon as 2029 or sooner](http://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-thinks-well-have-human-level-ai-by-2029-2014-12)), will perhaps one day be [mankind's last invention!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9snY7lhJA4c) For now though, AGI's predecessor, called **artificial _narrow_ intelligence**, also called **artificial intelligence**, can do amazing stuff like [diagnose diseases better than human doctors](https://futurism.com/ai-diagnose-heart-disease-lung-cancer-more-accurately-doctors/), or [give game characters the ability to learn to navigate game environments without human aid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44)! 

2. Crucially, the **Jamaican government** [has recognized that artificial narrow intelligence, a part of machine learning, is a threat to jobs](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180418/beware-artificial-intelligence-wheatley-warns-bpo-sector). Notably, [here's a list of jobs where robots or smart software are already replacing humans](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/money/21-jobs-where-robots-are-already-replacing-humans/ss-BBv6yiU#image=13). (Some great readings regarding job automation by robots or smart software, may additionally be found [in this list](https://disruptionhub.com/10-jobs-robots-replacing-humans/), and [in this one too](http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/future-tech/9-jobs-overtaken-by-robots-11364003046052).)

3. As the **first machine learning school established in Jamaica** (and probably the world's first machine learning dedicated university-like institution) on December 23, 2016, [MLJI](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/) seeks to help more and more Jamaicans to find out what steps they can take to acquire skills needed to **stay relevant** in a world that's more and more driven by artificial intelligence, that shall replace more and more jobs with physical robots and or smart software. 

4. As such, [MLJI](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/) is an institute that aims to bring more Jamaicans into the modern world of artificial intelligence and programming through fun, tailored lectures. Pertinently, see the "why" tab on the [MLJI website](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/), to find out why **high-schoolers, or even busy Masters/PhD/Professor people who are not trained in the machine learning field can participate in modern machine learning**!


# Curriculum
This curriculum is designed to cater to two main categories of users, including **non-programmers** and **programmers**. Those two categories naturally cover persons including those with **High school diplomas, Bachelors degrees, Masters degrees, PhDs, and Professorships**.

The two main categories above are expressible as 2 types, based on the goals that [MLJI](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/) desginates its students to perform.

As such, from here on out, you select one of the types below, and begin your learning process:

1. [MLJI For Non programmers (Type A)](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Machine-Learning-Jamaica-Institute_Curriculum-Type-A_Non-Programmers)
2. [MLJI For Programmers (Type B)](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Machine-Learning-Jamaica-Institute_Curriculum_MainProgrammerPage)

By the time you complete either one of [MLJI](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/)'s curriculum types above, you would be a marketable candidate, qualified to attain remote work with the capability to earn [beyond 80,000 USD per year](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/s/Remote-Data-Scientist-Salary), whether you're a high schooler or professor who was not priorly trained in [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning). Also, you would be in far better position for local work, and better able to prepare for automation of more and more jobs in the globe, and in the country.


# Curriculum Requirements
1. Candidates must have at least passed the [GSAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_Six_Achievement_Test) or completed the [PEP](http://www.moe.gov.jm/primary-exit-profile-pep). (Additionally, up to PhD/Professor level candidates are welcome too!)
2. Candidates must be willing to devote 6 to 8+ weeks to MLJI's curriculum. In other words, candidates must be willing to build himself/herself, by acquiring machine learning skills through MLJI's 6-8+ week curriculum.
